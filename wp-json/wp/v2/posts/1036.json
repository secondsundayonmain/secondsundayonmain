We are based out of my house in Cincinnati.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What inspires you?<\/strong><br \/>\nLogan (the other half of Root Base) and I are inspired by Action Movies, Heavy Metal, and Hand-Drawn Illustration from the 70&#8217;s, 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s. We watch a ton of movies while we draw and take a lot away from their Mythos and story-telling.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is your favorite part about Second Sunday on Main?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe like that it&#8217;s Downtown. It brings out all different kinds of people. People who would not necessarily have access to our products otherwise. It gives people a chance to see our stuff in person and meet us as creators. We don&#8217;t have a brick-and-mortar store so SSOM also lets us put our merchandising skills to work.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130401_170642.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"IMG_20130401_170642\" src=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130401_170642-1024x1024.jpg\" width=\"553\" height=\"553\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Fill in the blank: The best part about my city\/neighborhood is _________.<\/strong><br \/>\nThe best part about Cincinnati is its potential.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are your favorite local spots to shop, eat, or visit?<\/strong><br \/>\nCincinnati has such great access to the nature compared to other cities its size. I like to get outdoors as much as I can. Any forest or river will do for hiking, camping or canoeing.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130529_091857.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"IMG_20130529_091857\" src=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130529_091857-1024x1024.jpg\" width=\"553\" height=\"553\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you want people to take away from Root Base Apparel?<\/strong><br \/>\nWe want people to know that there are actual humans who still draw actual illustrations with their actual hands. We decided that from the inception of Root Base Apparel. There is little or no computer manipulation involved in the creation of our design. We think of our product as wearable art.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What advice would you offer to aspiring indie business owners?<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you have an idea you can make it a reality no matter how weird or far-fetched it seems. Don&#8217;t let other people tell you that it won&#8217;t work or succeed. And don&#8217;t be afraid of all the things that you think will be too hard to deal with (like taxes, and all the IRS stuff, or failure). Fear eats dreams.<\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130714_115414.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"IMG_20130714_115414\" src=\"http:\/\/secondsundayonmain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/IMG_20130714_115414-1024x1024.jpg\" width=\"553\" height=\"553\" \/><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em>You can find Root Base Apparel at Second Sunday on Main on August 11 or find them through their <a href=\"http:\/\/rootbaseapparel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>\u00c2\u00a0or on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RootBaseApparel\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Check out our interview with Jason Erler of Root Base Apparel, one of the vendors appearing at Second Sunday on Main on August 11th.
