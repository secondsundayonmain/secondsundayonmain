They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a versatile nod to classic rock and old soul with a new-age energy that will be perfect to set the tone for some street strolling. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let Gerald Collins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 classy appearance fool you; his angsty, sometimes James Brown-esque shrieking vocals (re: <a href=\"http:\/\/youtu.be\/3qSxbOG02So\">\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jerk Me Around\u00e2\u20ac\u009d<\/a>) shred the lines between punk rock and 90\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alternative in a mixed-tempo roller coaster that races around crafty guitar solos and fits of Collins concerted rage. Think Liam Lynch meets Steve Erkel Hendrix &#8212; check them out on the YouTubes.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3qSxbOG02So\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>Moving along, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play Rock-Paper-Scissors. (Put your fist away, rock is so predictable.) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking about the RPS Tent, where five fine bands will commandeer the soundwaves at the south end of Main at 13th Street.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/aaroncollins.bandcamp.com\/\"><strong>Aaron Collins<\/strong><\/a> starts the day at 12pm with a slower, more soulful approach to folk rock. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear influence of Brandon Boyd in there, so If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an Incubus fan it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to get things rolling.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Butler Tech School of the Arts<\/strong> is sending high school bands to rock the stage at 1pm, reminding us all how awesome it is to be young and in a band. One day we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re young, practicing guitar and ollies in our driveway, the next we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here, standing at SSOM with Korean BBQ stains on our shirt watching a form of our former self shred the gnar gnar rad before our nostalgic eyes.
