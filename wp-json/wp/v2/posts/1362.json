The breeze cools, the surrounding hills are blanketed with magnificent reds, yellows and oranges, people dig out their sleeves and long pants, and October\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s installment of Second Sunday on Main gives us all one more chance to come together as a neighborhood before the White Death of Winter beckons a dreary freeze that halts fun as we know it.<\/p>\n<p>And so, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the mood for a carnival. A Fall Carnival, complete with everything you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want on Main Street in the fall. That means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to come pick out your pumpkins from the Adopt-A-Plant Garden Center Pumpkin Market, grab your ghoulish threads at the Costume Swap, sport your best costume get-up for the Little Creatures Costume Parade at 3pm and take in all the seasonal goodness that merchants and vendors are serving up for your purchasing pleasure (trick-or-treating? Anyone??).<\/p>\n<p>At the Rock-Paper-Scissors tent, we have Joey Cook bringing indie pop tunes at noon, followed by Elia Goat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s folk music before taking a trip down the jazz lane with Oz Landenberg.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re painting the street with Pam Kravetz, visit the Art on the Streets tent for Jack Burton Overdrive at noon. If you dig the hoops, stick around to get your hoop on with Terri Burch and Hooproots from 1:45pm to 3:15pm, and round out the day by catching Jon Evans of We Are Snapdragon from 3:30pm to 5pm.<\/p>\n<p>The Cincinnati Sports Leagues Beer Garden returns with Rivertown Pumpkin Ale, Bluegrass Bourbon Barrel Ale, and Crispin Cider, with tips benefitting the Adore-A-Bull Rescue. We encourage you to grab a beer, and stroll the street hunting for these specials from our merchants and vendors.
